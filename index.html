            <a>Pinguin Studioz is a simple group created by xnzx_x or loser_man6. This group started under a different name *Roblox Dungeons Dev Team* which was refering to the first project of the group, Roblox Dungeons. Pinguin Studioz went on to work commisions in groups of two, split profits, and eventually xnzx_x and eaglesrok1 laid off majority of the dev team and decided to focus on projects, such as a FPS, an RPG, a Tycoon, and now the group is mostly inactive, few projects here and there. None of the games ever fully completed.</a>

            <h2 id="Lunar_Link">Lunar Works</h2> 
            <a>Lunar Works is the newest collaborative group consisting of eaglesrok1, dillhin07, and xnzx_x. The project began when eaglesrok1 invited both xnzx_x and dillhin07 to assist in the development of a simple war game. Graphics of the project are decently realistic, the gun systems are a bit complex but very fun to play with, and the overall core mechanics of the game make a fun and competitive game loop. The base mode as of this moment is capture the flag, it's a Team vs Team mode. The plans for this game are still heavy under development, but the main concept is a semi-realistic competitive war game. Due to how recent this group and this project is, and how it is currently on hold due to business on all devs sides, the game is buggy and unfinished. The game itself is unreleased, but some people did stress test the concept to experiment and see what players would think. This is the most likely to be completed project at the moment.</a>

            <h2 id="EmpireZ_Link">EmpireZ</h2> 
            <a>EmpireZ actually has multiple versions, this being the newest and most simplistic design. This version was completely designed and programmed by xnzx_x / loser_man6, however, the older versions were worked on by both xnzx_x and eaglesrok1. The older design had a login system with Fireship, a fullscreen video page, and a netflix inspired deisgn for the homepage. development of EmpireZ was interupted by xnzx_x's home life and lack of internet for a moment. The site itself had a domain registered *empirez.online* but that has been lost due to lack of development/interaction. It's a free streaming service using s3 bucket hosting for the videos, mobile friendly and simple designs, and a barebones system to list shows / seasons / episodes.</a>
